CC3000 Arduino-compatible 802.11b/g Wi-Fi shield   

Board must be fabbed with 1.6mm thick FR4 (although the microstrip impedence is not a strong function of board thickness), 2-layer 1 oz. Cu, with soldermask on both sides,
so that the 50-ohm coplanar waveguide has an impedence in the right ballpark.
